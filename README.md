# FootballSystem

## A system for managing the football association

Implementation of the system after a literature review of the subject,
building models - diagrams sequence system, class models, use cases, architecture diagram, and planning customer acceptance tests.

The implementation of the system is divided into 3 layers:
● Service Layer: Serves as a gateway to the system and provides entry (or starting) points for the version's usage stories.
The implementation of the layer reflects the dependencies between the usage stories.
● Domain layer: This layer is the heart of the system. It is divided into components, as decided in the architecture model of the system.
● Data access layer: This layer is responsible for managing the data within the database (MySQL)
